#Here's a basic Python code for a speech recognizer using the SpeechRecognition library:

import speech_recognition as sr
  
# Initialize recognizer
r = sr.Recognizer()

# Define microphone as audio source
mic = sr.Microphone()

# Adjust for ambient noise
with mic as source:
    r.adjust_for_ambient_noise(source)

# Listen for audio and recognize it as text
with mic as source:
    print("Listening....")
    r.pause_threshold = 1
    audio = r.listen(source)
    try:
        text = r.recognize_google(audio)
        print("You said: {}".format(text))
    except sr.UnknownValueError:
        print("I could not understand audio")
    except sr.RequestError as e:
        print("Could not request results from Google Speech Recognition service; {0}".format(e))


#Before running the script, ensure that the SpeechRecognition library has been installed
# via pip using the command `pip install SpeechRecognition`.
